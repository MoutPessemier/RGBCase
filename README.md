# RGB Case
I'm a total beginner when it comes to Arduino and this project is my first interaction with it.

This electric circuit can be used to make a light based on RGB values. You use the 3 turnknobs to pass along an RGB value, and the 3 leds will shine bright, giving you a nightstand lamp.

### Specifications
- NodeMCU V3
- 3 RGB LEDs
- 3 Turnknobs

### Usage
This script is free to use. It is intended to be used with 3 turn knobs and 3 RGB LEDs. You just have to change the pins to your setup and let the sketch do the rest.
